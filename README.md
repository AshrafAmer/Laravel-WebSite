# Laravel-Website
It is the source code for my first LARAVEL Site,. It is a website with a blog application and also includes full authentication and file uploading - image upload. Dealing with DataBase (CREATE - DELETE - UPDATE - READ).

## Source Files
I don't able to upload more than 100 Files. So this is a more important part of Project's code.
